# Audio Device Switcher for iRacing

A PowerShell script for seamlessly managing audio output devices when launching and exiting iRacing simulation software.

## Features

- Automatic detection of iRacing
- Automatic switching between default and VR audio device
- Automatic switching between default and VR microphone
- Persistent configuration
- Detailed logging with automatic log rotation
- Fault-tolerant audio device switching with retry mechanism
- User-friendly first-time setup
- Clean shutdown with CTRL+C

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or higher, PowerShell 7+ recommended
- Administrator rights for initial installation of AudioDeviceCmdlets module
- Windows 10/11 compatible audio devices
- iRacing simulation software

## Installation

1. Download the entire project folder.
2. Ensure PowerShell script execution is allowed:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. The required AudioDeviceCmdlets module will be installed automatically on first launch.

## First-Time Setup

1. Start the script `ir-audio-switch.ps1`.
2. On first run, you will be prompted to:
   - Select your default audio device.
   - Select your VR audio device.
   - Select your default microphone.
   - Select your VR microphone.
3. The selection is automatically saved.

## Usage

1. Start the script:
   ```powershell
   .\ir-audio-switch.ps1
   ```
2. The script runs in the background and monitors iRacing:
   - When iRacing starts, it automatically switches to the VR audio device and VR microphone.
   - When iRacing closes, it switches back to the default audio device and default microphone.
3. Exit the script with CTRL+C.

## Configuration

The configuration is stored in `ir-audio-switch.cfg.json` and contains:
- Default audio device (`defaultDevice`)
- VR audio device (`vrDevice`)
- Default microphone (`defaultMic`)
- VR microphone (`vrMic`)
- Maximum number of log lines (`maxLogLines`)

### Parameters

The script accepts the following parameters:
- `-LogFile`: Path to the log file (default: ir-audio-switch.log in script directory)
- `-MaxLogLines`: Maximum number of lines to keep in the log file (default: 42, range: 10-10000)

Example:

```powershell
.\ir-audio-switch.ps1 -LogFile "C:\path\to\logfile.log" -MaxLogLines 100
```

## Configuration Examples

Example configuration in `ir-audio-switch.cfg.json` for a typical VR racing setup:

```json
{
  "defaultDevice": "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)",
  "vrDevice": "Headphones (Oculus Virtual Audio Device)",
  "defaultMic": "Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)",
  "vrMic": "Microphone (Oculus Virtual Audio Device)",
  "maxLogLines": 100
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that your audio devices are properly connected and recognized by Windows.
2. Check the log file for any error messages.
3. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the script and change audio devices.
4. Re-run the first-time setup if you have changed your audio devices.
